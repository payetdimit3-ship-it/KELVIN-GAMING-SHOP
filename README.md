## AI
The server supports four direct AI providers:
- Google Gemini
- OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- Anthropic

Set the keys only in Render Environment Variables. Never commit API keys to GitHub.

Recommended Render variables:
`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
plus the model variables shown in `.env.example`.

`NEXUS_AI_PRIMARY` chooses the first provider and `NEXUS_AI_FALLBACK` is the second choice. Any other configured provider can be used as an additional fallback.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Render:
- Build Command: `npm install`
- Start Command: `npm start`

This project stores runtime JSON data in `.data/` and can back it up to Supabase when `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` are configured.


## 🆕 MEDIA + AI BUILDER UPDATE (17 Sep 2026)

### Public pages
- `live.html` — customers watch admin-published live match streams or uploaded match videos.
- `movies.html` — customers watch movie/video uploads.
- `courses.html` — course library with per-course video players + AI Course Tutor.
- `health.html` — Health AI with text + browser voice input/output.
- Global `chat.js` AI assistant now includes microphone input and automatic voice read-out.

### Admin Dashboard
New **📺 Media & Live** tab:
- Add live match/stream using an embed URL or video URL.
- Upload Movies (MP4/WebM/MOV).
- Create courses.
- Upload a video for each course.

New **🧠 AI Web Developer & Manager**:
- Internal Claude-powered JSON action builder.
- Preview or execute approved changes from a prompt box.
- Supported safe actions: products, banners, movies, course videos, live matches and settings.
- It intentionally does NOT execute arbitrary raw JavaScript/SQL/HTML sent by the model.

### Storage
For production on Render, configure Supabase Storage:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=gamehub-media
```
The server creates/uses the `gamehub-media` bucket if available; local `/uploads` is only a fallback and may be ephemeral on Render.

### AI Builder
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
NEXUS_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```
Keep all AI/payment secrets only in Render environment variables, never in frontend HTML/JS.

### Important
Only upload/stream movies and sports content that you have the right/permission to distribute. The live page is a player for streams that the admin controls; it does not provide a source of copyrighted broadcasts.


## Live stream links
- YouTube watch/live links are automatically converted to YouTube embed URLs.
- Direct MP4/WebM files play in the built-in video player.
- HLS `.m3u8` streams use hls.js when supported.
- A normal webpage URL cannot always be embedded because the source site may block iframe embedding (X-Frame-Options/CSP).


## Production persistence & payments (important)
Set these on Render before production use:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server only)
- `SUPABASE_KV_TABLE=kv_store`
- `AZAMPAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` or `production`
- `AZAMPAY_APP_NAME`, `AZAMPAY_CLIENT_ID`, `AZAMPAY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Optional `AZAMPAY_API_KEY` and `AZAMPAY_API_BASE` according to your current AzamPay merchant documentation.

The checkout page now calls `/api/azampay-pay` and polls `/api/azampay-check/:ref`. The old `/api/clickpesa-*` routes are kept as compatibility aliases.

If `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing, Render's local filesystem is not a durable database and product/order data can disappear after a restart/redeploy. The Admin Command Center shows a storage warning in that case.

### Supabase `kv_store` table (if missing)
Run once in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.kv_store (
  file_name text primary key,
  data jsonb not null,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.kv_store enable row level security;
```

The GameHub server uses the service-role key server-side to read/write this table. Do not expose that key in frontend code.


## UI Update — Professional Store + Hero Studio
- Home hero imebakizwa kama clean gaming hero; trailer cards sasa ziko chini ya hero.
- Kila product ya Shop yenye `trailerUrl` inaonekana kwenye Featured Trailers ikiwa na game name, image, Admin price na Buy Now.
- Admin imepata Dashboard/Overview iliyorejeshwa, Command Center, na Hero Studio bila kuondoa modules za Orders, Customers, Products, Requests, Marketplace, Coupons, Security, Media & Live na AI.
- Hero Studio inaruhusu kuchagua product na kuongeza/kuondoa YouTube, MP4 au WebM trailer. Bei inasomwa moja kwa moja kutoka product, hivyo ikibadilishwa Admin inabadilika Home.
- Orders filters/export na dashboard functions zimeunganishwa kikamilifu; previous missing `loadOrders`, `loadCommandCenter`, `refreshAll`, `renderOrderFilters` na `exportOrdersCSV` zimerudishwa.
- Global storefront styles zimepandishwa kuwa professional dark gaming UI yenye responsive mobile layout.

## LIFEISGAMETZ Pro V3 — Hero, Public Chat & Payments

### Hero / trailers
- Admin → Hero Studio → chagua game → weka Trailer URL.
- Home inaonyesha trailer kubwa juu, kisha Hero copy iko chini ya video.
- Kila trailer inasoma `name`, `imageUrl` na `price` moja kwa moja kutoka product, na ina **Buy Now**.
- Ukibadilisha bei kwenye Bidhaa, bei ya trailer inabadilika pia.

### Public Chat
- `chat.html` ni public na haihitaji login.
- Messages zinahifadhiwa kwenye `public_chat.json` na zinaweza kubackup kupitia Supabase KV.
- Admin → Public Chat inaweza kuondoa ujumbe.

### AzamPay
- Checkout sasa inaruhusu kuchagua provider: `Mpesa`, `Tigo`, `Airtel`, `Halopesa`, `Azampesa`.
- Render env lazima itumie `AZAMPAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` au `production`.
- Weka `AZAMPAY_APP_NAME`, `AZAMPAY_CLIENT_ID`, `AZAMPAY_CLIENT_SECRET`; `AZAMPAY_API_KEY`/`AZAMPAY_API_BASE` hutumika pale merchant docs zako zinapohitaji.
- Callback endpoint ya app ni `/api/azampay-callback`; merchant callback lazima isetiwe kwenye AzamPay merchant/developer configuration kwa URL ya Render ya app yako.
- Admin → Payments inaonyesha kama credentials zimesanidiwa bila kuonyesha secrets.
- Manual payment bado ipo kama fallback na sasa writes zake zinasubiriwa (`await`) ili data isiwe stale kabla ya response.

## 🎨 ZONEPLAY REDESIGN (V6)

One layout for every page (sidebar + topbar + mobile bottom navigation), dark mode.

- `zoneplay-full.css` — design system (tokens, shell, poster cards, hero, tiles, legacy-page skin)
- `zoneplay-shell.js` — builds the sidebar / topbar / bottom nav on **every** page that includes it, marks the active item, shows the logged-in user, cart badge and admin link
- `zp-catalog.js` — shared product loader (`/api/products` + seeded defaults), platform detection and poster cards
- Rebuilt pages: `index.html` (Home), `shop.html` (Store + PSP/PS2/PS3/Switch/Android/PC via `?cat=`), `categories.html` (Games)
- Platform pages use the product's `category` / `type` / `name` (e.g. "PSP", "PS2", "Nintendo Switch"); set the category in Admin → Products to place a game on a platform page.
- Home hero shows admin product trailers/images and `/api/banners`; falls back to built-in slides.
- Remaining pages keep their content and get the new layout + skin; they are redesigned module by module.

### Live Scores
`livescores.html` reads `/api/live-streams` (the matches admin adds under Media & Live). Admin can now set **home/away goals and minute** when adding a match, and update score/status from the list (💾) — new endpoint `POST /api/admin/live-streams/:id/score`.

### Live TV / Sports
`live.html` — one main player (YouTube, MP4/WebM, HLS `.m3u8`, or embed URL), a list of current matches and a card grid. Deep link: `live.html?id=<streamId>` (used by the Live Scores "Tazama" button). The 30s refresh only touches the player when the stream actually changes.

### Gift Cards
`giftcards.html` — brand tiles (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, Google Play, Apple, Roblox; only brands that have products are shown) + card-faced products with search and sort. Products come from the store catalogue (kind = gift card). Brands are text wordmarks, no logos.

### Academy
`academy.html` — hero with live course/video counts, real courses from `/api/courses` (card → `courses.html?id=`), learning-path tiles, AI Mentor. `courses.html` — one player + lesson playlist (auto-plays next lesson), course tabs, AI Course Tutor (text, mic, read-aloud) via `/api/ai/chat`. Deep links: `courses.html?id=<courseId>&v=<videoId>`, `courses.html#tutor`.

### Cloud Gaming
`cloudgaming.html` — hero, 4-step flow, rental packages and pre-flight notes. Package values come from `ZP.RENTAL` in `zp-catalog.js` (same numbers as `rental.html`); all buttons lead to `rental.html`, which still has the original layout.

### Rental
`rental.html` — packages, custom-time calculator (max 24h) and live cart summary. Packages/prices come from `ZP.RENTAL`, and the custom price rule from `ZP.rentalPrice()` in `zp-catalog.js` (also used by `cloudgaming.html`). Cart items keep the original shape (`rent<min>` / `rentC<min>-<ts>`, `rentalMinutes`).

### Movies
`movies.html` — featured (newest) banner, search + genre chips + sort, poster grid (uses the movie `poster` URL when set, otherwise a generated cover) and a player modal (YouTube or direct/uploaded video; playback stops on close). Deep link: `movies.html?id=<movieId>`. Data: `/api/movies`.

### Community / Chat
`chat.html` — public room (`/api/public-chat/messages`, unchanged API): grouped messages with day separators, your own messages on the right (ids kept only in this browser's localStorage), nickname remembered, inline errors (incl. the server's rate-limit message), quick emoji, optional voice input, polling every 7s that never moves the scroll position unless you are at the bottom. `community.html` (Community Help) is a different page and keeps its old layout for now.

### Health Assistant
`health.html` — prominent (non-dismissible) medical disclaimer, chat with the health AI (`POST /api/ai/health` with `{message, history[last 8]}`, unchanged), suggested questions, voice input (auto-sends), read-aloud, reset button, and links to Health Network / Recovery / Community Fund / Community Help. Nothing from the conversation is stored in the browser.

### eFootball
`efootball.html` — hero, tabs to Coins & Top-Up / Tournaments, squad poster grid (products with `section:'efootball'`, loaded with `ZP.loadSection('efootball')`), search + sort, wishlist hearts, links to related pages. `topup.html` (Coins) keeps its old layout for now.

### Coins & Top-Up
`topup.html` — top-up packages from the catalogue (any admin section, kind = top-up/coins/points, plus the built-in defaults), filter by game, search, sort; falls back to the defaults if the API is unreachable. Contact details live in `ZP.CONTACT` (`zp-catalog.js`): WhatsApp 0786 095 758, lifeisgametz@gmail.com. Old placeholder numbers/emails in page footers were replaced site-wide.

### AI Assistant
`ai.html` (sidebar → AI Assistant) — full-page version of the site chat: suggested questions, conversation with the last 10 turns sent as `history` to `POST /api/ai/chat` (unchanged), voice input, read-aloud on demand (no auto-speak), reset, and WhatsApp/email handoff. The floating chat bubble is hidden on this page; the header AI button focuses the input here.

### Marketplace
`marketplace.html` — partner businesses from `/api/marketplace` (admin-posted): search, category chips, sort, cards with WhatsApp / email / website button built from the listing's `contact` (local numbers like 0712… are converted to wa.me/255712…; anything else is shown as plain text). "Orodhesha Biashara" opens WhatsApp with a prefilled message.

### My Games / Library
`mygames.html` — (1) rental timers from `localStorage.gamehubRentals` (live countdown + progress bar, last 5 finished ones kept as history), (2) GeForce NOW launcher, (3) Library built from the customer's *successful* orders via `GET /api/my-orders` (download links; account details are hidden until clicked, with copy buttons; rentals are excluded). Pending orders are counted with a link to `myorders.html`.

### Cart
`cart.html` — rows with quantity stepper (1–99), remove with undo toast, two-step "Futa Kikapu", live total and count, payment-method chips, and suggested products when empty. Same storage key/shape (`gamehubCart`), so `checkout.html` and `rental.html` are unaffected. Item names are escaped before rendering.

### Wishlist
`wishlist.html` — saved games (`localStorage.gamehubWishlist`, price accepted as number or "45,000 TZS") shown as poster cards; prices are refreshed from the shop (`ZP.loadSection('*')` + built-in defaults): chips show "Bei imeshuka/imepanda" or "HAIPATIKANI TENA" (only when the shop answered). Heart removes with an undo toast, "Futa zote" needs a second click, sort by newest/price/name. Buying goes through `product.html` so the cart item keeps its usual shape.

### Profile
`profile.html` — account card (name, email, role), stats (orders / active rentals / wishlist / cart), tournament balance when > 0, shortcuts, logout, admin button, WhatsApp for account changes. **Fix:** the old page called `/api/auth/me` without the `Authorization` token, so it always said "Ingia kwanza"; it now sends `gamehubToken`. There is no profile-edit API, so nothing is editable here yet.

### Checkout
`checkout.html` — two-column layout (payment on the left, order summary + coupon on the right; summary first on phones). **Payment API contract unchanged:** `POST /api/coupons/check`, `POST /api/azampay-pay {total, phone(255…), provider, name, items}` then polling `GET /api/azampay-check/:tx_ref` every 5s (max 36), `POST /api/manual-pay {items,total,txRef,phone}`; cart/quick-buy sources (`gamehubCart`, `?quick=1` + `gamehubQuickBuy`) and success handling (`gamehubLastOrder`, cart cleared, redirect to `success.html` / `myorders.html`) are the same. Changes: names escaped, phone validated (255 + 9 digits) before calling the API, login banner up front, name prefilled from the account, the unused e-mail field replaced by a note showing the account e-mail, and the internal note about Render merchant credentials removed from the customer-facing page.
**Known risk (server side, not changed):** totals, item prices and the coupon discount are computed in the browser and trusted by the server — re-price the order on the server before going live.

### Login
`login.html` — split layout (welcome panel + form), password show/hide, "Umesahau password?" hands over to WhatsApp support with the typed e-mail (there is no reset API), already-signed-in notice. **Fix:** checkout sends `login.html?return=checkout.html` but the old page always went to `index.html`; it now returns to the requested page. Only plain same-site pages (`name.html` with an optional query) are accepted — external, `//` and `../` targets fall back to `index.html`. API unchanged: `POST /api/auth/login` → `gamehubToken` + `gamehubUser`. `register.html` still ignores `?return=` (next page).

### Register
`register.html` — same split layout as `login.html`, password show/hide, already-signed-in notice, client-side checks matching the server (`password.length>=4`, optional phone format), and now honours `?return=` the same safe way as Login (falls back to `index.html` for anything that isn't a plain same-site page). API unchanged: `POST /api/auth/register`.

### Settings (new — device preferences, no account-settings API exists)
`settings.html` — device-only preferences (stored under `zp_*` keys in localStorage via `ZP.pref`/`ZP.setPref` in `zp-catalog.js`), reachable from the sidebar (ZAIDI) and the account menu:
- **AI reply language** (Kiswahili/English) — applied to every AI call (`ai.html`, `health.html`, `courses.html` tutor) by prefixing the message with an instruction via `ZP.aiMessage()`; Swahili is the default and leaves messages unchanged.
- **Data Saver** (`ZP.dataSaver()`) — when on, video/stream embeds don't autoplay: Home hero slides, `live.html`'s player and the `movies.html` modal all show a tap-to-play overlay instead.
- **Sauti ya Ujumbe Mpya** — a short Web Audio beep (`ZP.beep()`, no audio file) when Community Chat receives a new message from someone else (not your own, not the initial load).
- Device-data summary (cart/wishlist/active-rental counts) and a two-step "Futa Data ya Kifaa" that clears cart, wishlist and these preferences on this browser only — account, orders and rentals are untouched.
- No account-detail fields (name/email/password) — the server has no endpoint for that; a WhatsApp button is offered instead, same as Profile.

### Community Help
`community.html` — hero, 4 pillar cards (Health Education → `health.html`, Online Safety, Financial Literacy, Emergency Information — the last 3 jump to sections on this page), safety/financial tip lists (general, non-diagnostic advice), a strip linking to Health Network / Recovery Support / Community Fund / Community Chat, and a non-specific emergency notice (no invented phone numbers — it points people to local official services). WhatsApp buttons open with a prefilled message. **Fix:** removed a stale sidebar alias that made `community.html` highlight "Community / Chat" instead of its own "Community Help" entry.
**Known site-wide quirk (not introduced here):** the floating "Msaidizi AI" button (`#ghChatBtn` in `chat.js`) is fixed at the bottom-right on every page and can sit over content on long mobile pages, including this one.
